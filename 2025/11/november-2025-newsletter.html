    <h3 id="giving-thanks-to-the-helpers">Giving Thanks to the Helpers</h3>

<p>This year has been challenging to so many of us and our communities that I wanted to take a moment to thank everyone for the work you all are doing and supporting both inside and outside of our own groups. 2025 was a year marked with the decimation of many premier organizations in our field including the United States Digital Service, 18F, as well as countless civil servants within federal agencies being forced from public service. The cuts to SNAP benefits, even before the shutdown threatened to cut them off completely, are greatly concerning to those who want everyone in our communities to have access to healthy food. For cities like mine with large immigrant populations, the actions of federal immigration agents kidnapping our neighbors and deploying tear gas on the streets in which we live has been the stuff of nightmares.  </p>

<p>It’s times like these that I’m particularly thankful for the helpers and those bringing people together to find solutions to problems in our neighborhoods. Florida Community Innovation recently launched a <a href="https://www.floridaresourcemap.org/">resource map to help people find</a> food, aid, and shelter. The efforts from <a href="https://www.civictechatlanta.org/">Civic Tech Atlanta</a> to support Solidarity Food Pantry are paying further dividends as the need for food aid increases.  It’s also been a year of bringing people together. <a href="https://www.beta.nyc/">BetaNYC</a> had over 600 registrations for their NYC School of Data event! Their annual gathering brings together civic technologists, data enthusiasts, and community leaders to learn, collaborate, and drive innovation. ACT members also hosted nine different <a href="https://citycamp.com/">CityCamps</a> throughout the country helping bring together technologists, public servants and community leaders to find ways that technology can enable good work in our neighborhoods. OpenAustin held a <a href="https://open-austin.odoo.com/fellowship">twelve week fellowship</a> to develop aspiring technologists’ confidence, technical competence, and collaboration through experiential learning and mentorship. </p>

<p>While these examples have mostly been civic tech focused, we’d be remiss if we didn’t acknowledge the community organizing and activism that occurs outside those spaces. The challenge of the times will take work from all of us in many different ways - and I’m thankful for them all. </p>

<h3 id="act-virtual-holiday-party">ACT Virtual Holiday Party</h3>

<p>ACT will be hosting its second annual virtual holiday party on Thursday, December 18th, at 9PM EST / 6pm PST. Join us as we share wins, network, and commiserate before the new year. The event is free and open to anyone in the civic tech space. <a href="https://us06web.zoom.us/meeting/register/hUpM6oNYS-yW_jHXcfrFGA">You can register online here.</a></p>

<h3 id="network-roundup">Network Roundup</h3>

<p>Here are some quick notes, about what’s been happening in the network!</p>

<h4 id="betanycs-noel-hidalgo-selected-to-serve-on-mayor-elect-mamdanis-transition-team">BetaNYC’s Noel Hidalgo selected to serve on Mayor-Elect Mamdani’s transition team </h4>

<p><a href="http://beta.nyc/">BetaNYC</a> Executive Director Noel Hidalgo was selected to serve on Mayor-Elect Zohran Mamdani’s transition team as part of the Committee on Technology.  BetaNYC <a href="https://www.beta.nyc/2025/11/18/dear-mayor-elect-8-gov-tech-ideas/">recently published a list of 8 tech ideas for the Mamdani administration’s first 100 days</a>. BetaNYC is a civic organization dedicated to improving lives in New York through civic design, technology, and data. BetaNYC helps all New Yorkers access information and use technology for the public interest. Noel Hidalgo has been organizing BetaNYC since 2008 and serves on ACT’s Board of Directors. </p>

<p>Do you love using your organizational and project management skills for good? Florida Community Innovation Foundation could use your help! Specifically, our executive director, Caroline Nickerson, PhD could use support coordinating with both our community partners and student teams to keep our civic tech projects on track. Some of these projects include: FCI’s public affairs efforts, the Florida Resource Map, and more. Please email info@floridainnovation.org if you’re interested!</p>

<h4 id="city-camp-survey-and-thank-you">City Camp Survey and Thank You</h4>

<p>Thank you to everyone who attended and hosted <a href="https://citycamp.com/">CityCamp 2025</a> events! Throughout September and October of 2025, ACT partnered with CityCamp to organize nine different events across the country to bring together technologists, community leaders, and city stakeholders to foster civic collaboration and innovation. Many of our member orgs are still working on follow up to CityCamp, so follow them on social media to hear more! <a href="https://www.beta.nyc/2025/10/02/citycampnyc-recap/">Check out BetaNYC’s recap to learn more about how they sparked conversations for a more transparent, inclusive, and resilient city</a>. </p>

<p>Please share any pictures from<a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Cj7NZCiJpwHXEx-rPoH8LrpQSdVKSxcm?usp=drive_link">CityCamp events in your city’s Google Drive folder</a>. 
We hope to make this a successful event for years to come - which is why we want to hear feedback from organizers and attendees. Please fill out one of the surveys below so we can improve (feedback will be shared with organizers):</p>
