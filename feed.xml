&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the ACT July Newsletter! Weâ€™re hoping that everyone is staying safe and cool during the extreme weather weâ€™re having.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;writing-out-our-values&quot;&gt;Writing out our values&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a few weeks of reviewing what volunteer groups put together in 2017, we now have an initial draft of our mission, values, and operating principles. Thank you to everyone who contributed their feedback!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next step will be to share the draft document with our delegates for feedback. Weâ€™ll meet at a delegate-only meeting on July 27th to review the proposal and possibly vote for its approval. In the meantime, you can read and &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DMUMw9Vm0b8rQ7_EnKwGouUXJrIIykIFxTcDxWjZcms/edit&quot;&gt;comment on the proposed document here&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;code-for-bostons-maple-testimony-goes-live-in-massachusetts&quot;&gt;Code for Bostonâ€™s MAPLE Testimony goes live in Massachusetts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bostonglobe.com/2023/04/13/opinion/civic-tech-maple-massachusetts/&quot;&gt;Boston Globe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://commonwealthmagazine.org/politics/a-digital-push-for-more-legislative-participation/&quot;&gt;Commonwealth Magazine&lt;/a&gt;, Code for Bostonâ€™s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mapletestimony.org/&quot;&gt;MAPLE app&lt;/a&gt; - the Massachusetts Platform for Legislative Engagement - aims to make it easy for MA residents to submit testimony to the state Legislature on the bills that determine the future of the Commonwealth. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eventbrite.com/e/the-massachusetts-platform-for-legislative-engagement-launch-event-tickets-657791430877&quot;&gt;MAPLE will launch their v1 app on Thursday, July 20&lt;/a&gt; after a year of amazing work by a dedicated team of Code for Boston volunteers, led by Matt Victor, in partnership with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nulawlab.org/&quot;&gt;NULawLab&lt;/a&gt; at Northeastern. Learn more about the project (and check out the code!) on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/codeforboston/maple&quot;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;florida-resource-map&quot;&gt;Florida Resource Map&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent months, student interns and the developer team at &lt;a href=&quot;https://floridainnovation.org/&quot;&gt;Florida Community Innovation&lt;/a&gt; (FCI) have been creating version three of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.floridaresourcemap.org/&quot;&gt;Florida Resource Map&lt;/a&gt;. The Map is a tool for Floridians to find social services (food banks, job resources, healthcare, etc.) near them on a unified digital platform. Our tool is also designed so social workers can customize suggestions of resources for their clients. The Map will compile a database of resources gathered from our nonprofit partners across Florida.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;act-reaches-twenty-members&quot;&gt;ACT reaches twenty members&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ACT continues to grow, with three more members signing on and bringing our total number of members to twenty. We were recently joined by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.codeforatlanta.org/&quot;&gt;Code for Atlanta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.meetup.com/code-for-hawaii/&quot;&gt;Code for Hawaii&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://openstl.org/&quot;&gt;OpenSTL&lt;/a&gt; (St Louis).Â &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Does your local civic tech organization have a story to tell? Want to be featured in our next newsletter? Reach out to us at hello@civictechnologists.org&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;thanks-for-all-you-do&quot;&gt;Thanks for all you do!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks again for all of your support and everything you do.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>ACT June Social Hour</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Happy Friday!  The Alliance of Civic Technologists would like to invite you to a virtual social hour on June 29th at 8:30 PM EST / 5:30 PM to celebrate our filing as a 501c3!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is our first step in becoming a fully-fledged non-profit. Weâ€™ll be filing in Illinois on Thursday and weâ€™ll work with delegates from member organizations across the county to write our bylaws and continue the work supporting the civic technology volunteer network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://us06web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZUoduutrj0pHNGBZ3zoYJwGE21n8AvtlRoo&quot;&gt;You can register for the social hour here!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks so much for all you do,&lt;br /&gt;
Christopher, Jill, and Harlan&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>ACT June Newsletter</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello! Welcome to our first newsletter! Itâ€™s been a month since we first launched the Alliance of Civic Technologists and we wanted to give an update on our progress and whatâ€™s next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But first we wanted to give a big thank you to our initial volunteers and donors. Our launch would not have been possible without people raising their hands to help us stand up the network! Thank you! ðŸŽ‰&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our First ACT Meeting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weâ€™re giving former members of Code for America Brigades and interested local civic tech organizations until Friday, June 16th to sign their letters of intent and name their delegates. On Monday, June 19th weâ€™ll send out a pool asking delegates to indicate their availability for our first meeting. If you are a local leader and havenâ€™t received your letter of intent, please email &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:hello@civictechnologists.org&quot;&gt;hello@civictechnologists.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Logo!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If youâ€™ve visited our website, &lt;a href=&quot;https://civictechnologists.org&quot;&gt;civictechnologists.org&lt;/a&gt;, in the last week, you may have noticed that we have a new logo! The connected star logo was inspired by Code for Australiaâ€™s original â€˜networkâ€™ design with ACT taking a page out of Canadaâ€™s book and using the flag star to represent the US. Our colors are Old Glory Red and Democracy Blue. We wanted to give a big shout out to Molly McLeod (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mollymcleod.com/&quot;&gt;https://www.mollymcleod.com/&lt;/a&gt;) for the design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Call for Feedback on our Vision, Mission and Values&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2017, the civic technology organizations came together at Code for Americaâ€™s Brigade Congress and drafted a Mission/Vision/Operating Principles document that reflected the values of the Brigade network. Since that time, Code for America has taken the finalized document off their website. However, this document was preserved in Github and ACT has forked it as itâ€™s a useful starting point for setting our own vision, mission, and values. You can comment and suggest changes &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h-cNQtJrMZi3yaohQIJPMbxh4lnKzUQtI_Vm0ptBExA/edit&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Weâ€™ll keep the comment section open until we formally adopt our governance structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay in touch via Discord&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If youâ€™re interested in chatting with the community in real time, we have an open discord server at &amp;lt;&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks so much,&lt;br /&gt;
The ACT Comms Team&lt;br /&gt;
(Christopher, Brianda, Ben and Jill)&lt;/p&gt;
