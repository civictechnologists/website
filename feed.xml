        <title>ACT Newsletter March 2025: First Resolution, Organizers Needed, We Support 18F, Network Roundup, Spring Virtual Happy Hour</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;first-resolution&quot;&gt;First Resolution&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the most recent delegates meeting, the first resolution for the Alliance of Civic Technologists (ACT) was unanimously passed. &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WVGqfxORJQqpzm-RiM8wf1PgiR2JTzekW-vMnxX-srk/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;RESOLUTION ONE - TWENTY-TWENTY-FIVE&lt;/a&gt; is a direct response from ACT and its members to the current administration’s executive orders and actions that are adversely impacting the rights of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans, and Queer/Questioning (LGBTQ+) individuals, Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEIA) initiatives, immigrant communities, and the federal workforce. This resolution also serves as a strong statement of support for these communities and programs by ACT’s members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“In short, our communities welcome all - but compassionately reject harmful actions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;join-our-network-organizers-needed&quot;&gt;Join Our Network: Organizers Needed&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Alliance of Civic Technologists is actively recruiting organizers to support member organizations in Tulsa, Baltimore, Dallas, and Nebraska. If you’re passionate about making an impact, we’d love to hear from you! Reach out to &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:hello@civictechnologists.org&quot;&gt;hello@civictechnologists.org&lt;/a&gt; to get involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;we-support-18f&quot;&gt;We Support 18F&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of March 1, 2025, 18F, a program within the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gsa.gov/&quot;&gt;General Services Administration (GSA)&lt;/a&gt;, has officially been &lt;a href=&quot;https://fedscoop.com/gsa-shutters-18f-possibly-leaving-agencies-in-the-lurch/&quot;&gt;shut down&lt;/a&gt;. However, the talented team of tech consultants and engineers, who built open-source tools to improve digital services across the federal government has &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/alt18f.bsky.social&quot;&gt;come together&lt;/a&gt;. Their dedication to helping, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://18f.org/#:~:text=the%20government%20to%20fix%20things&quot;&gt;the government to fix things&lt;/a&gt;,” is absolutely inspirational, and we’re excited to witness their work as they continue their mission, driving a positive change in the civic tech community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;network-roundup&quot;&gt;Network Roundup&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some quick notes about what’s been happening in the network!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://codeforphilly.org/&quot;&gt;Code for Philly&lt;/a&gt; is building an ultimate toolkit, called &lt;a href=&quot;https://cleanandgreenphilly.org/&quot;&gt;Clean &amp;amp; Green Philly&lt;/a&gt;, for local community groups to reduce gun violence by cleaning and greening vacant properties.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://beta.nyc/&quot;&gt;BetaNYC&lt;/a&gt; celebrates over a decade of observing March as “&lt;a href=&quot;https://sunshineweek.org/&quot;&gt;Sunshine Month&lt;/a&gt;”, where open government, freedom of information, and the City’s open data law are at the forefront, by co-hosting &lt;a href=&quot;https://2025.open-data.nyc/&quot;&gt;NYC Open Data Week&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://schoolofdata.nyc/&quot;&gt;NYC School of Data&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://chihacknight.org/&quot;&gt;Chi Hack Night&lt;/a&gt; recently held their &lt;a href=&quot;https://chihacknight.org/blog/2025/02/18/election-results&quot;&gt;sixth Board of Directors election&lt;/a&gt;, with a majority of their official members turning out to cast their vote.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://floridainnovation.org/&quot;&gt;Florida Community Innovation (FCI)&lt;/a&gt; released their &lt;a href=&quot;https://floridainnovation.org/2025/02/26/fci-handbook/&quot;&gt;new handbook&lt;/a&gt;, detailing what FCI is, their projects, and more.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://opensac.org/&quot;&gt;Open Sacramento&lt;/a&gt; celebrates their new name with a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://opensac.org/&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Civic Tech is About Benefiting The Public Good, not Government Efficiency</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Christopher Whitaker and Derek Eder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;/media/2025/cancer_or_dinosaurs.jpg&quot;&gt;
          &lt;img src=&quot;/media/2025/cancer_or_dinosaurs.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A spiderman comic: I don&apos;t want to cure cancer, I want to turn people into dinosaurs!&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 300px&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The past few weeks have featured an unprecedented assault on the United States Constitution, civil rights, and America’s public servants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And contrary to some media narratives, there’s fierce opposition to everything that’s happening. That opposition will play out in the courts. It will play out in the streets and it will eventually play out at the ballot box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These efforts will take time.  As most of us are non-partisan, non-profits, these efforts take place outside our lanes. This does not negate those efforts, this post is mostly aimed at what civic tech volunteer groups can do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Authoritarian regimes want to crush the opposition. Part of this means ensuring that if you’re not compliant, things will be unbearable and unsustainable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, one of the best uses of our time and effort is in &lt;em&gt;harm reduction.&lt;/em&gt; Reducing the harm brought on by the new administration will buy time and space for vulnerable communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reducing harm will mean empowering and enabling community organisations that are on the front lines supporting vulnerable communities helping to solve their problems and enhance their capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest wins that civic tech likes to brag about is Clear My Record — a product that helps to expunge weed convictions from criminal records. For one thing, this only works in states  that allow for that. And how did we states that allowed for that? Years and years of grassroots activists doing the work of community organizing and advocating for change. The biggest piece and the hardest part had nothing to do with tech. You had to literally change laws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The activists and their advocates in the legislature were the ones driving the effort. Civic technologists came in during the implementation phase and helped to enable it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civictechatlanta.org/&quot;&gt;Civic Tech Atlanta&lt;/a&gt; partnered with Solidarity Food Pantry to help clean up their data and create user friendly improvements to their reporting system. The pantry, started in March 2020 to help food-insecure families during the COVID shutdowns. That grew into a community movement to help overlooked families. Civic Tech Atlanta was honored to help those families feel uplifted, supported and food secure. Solidarity Pantry has helped serve over 100,000 people since its opening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While taking the opportunity to make some internal changes during moving physical locations, Solidarity realized they had a need to improve their current data quality and data intake system. Partially for the sake of organization and reporting, but primarily to prepare for a future data migration, Solidarity needed to review their historical data and reporting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Civic Tech Atlanta worked with Solidarity to review historical data and identify data validation issues (potential duplicates, invalid addresses, entry errors, etc.), propose simple improvements to the current ad-hoc reporting system and understand the data and assist in preparing a data structure for a future migration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s important to keep the concept of &lt;em&gt;enablement&lt;/em&gt; in mind - because what we enable is important. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eatingpolicy.com/p/bringing-elon-to-a-knife-fight&quot;&gt;Government efficiency, in it of itself, is not harm reduction.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot of work to be done to push back against the oligarchy. Some of this work will be political, some of this work will be in the courts, and some of it will be on the streets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, here are some steps you can take to support your communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-one-find-your-team&quot;&gt;Step One: Find your team&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developing technology is a team sport, and even more so in the field of civic technology. There’s very little you can achieve solo. So, the first step is to find a team. If you’re in Chicago, your starting point will be Chi Hack Night at one of our weekly hack nights. For those outside of Chicago, the Alliance of Civic Technologists is a network of local organizations with member organizations in 13 cities and recruiting brand new volunteer civic tech volunteer groups. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civictechnologists.org/about&quot;&gt;You can find a list of our current members on our website&lt;/a&gt;!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideally, you want to have enough skillsets on your team to be able to take on a variety of challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-two-find-your-allies-and-understand-their-needs&quot;&gt;Step Two: Find your allies and understand their needs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You probably have a particular set of skills and experiences that make you great at creating code, or designing great user experiences, or understanding how to use and manipulate data. These are usual skills, but you likely lack domain knowledge and expertise for problem sets like immigrant rights, investigating corruption, health care, and criminal justice reform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For every major problem we’re facing, there’s likely a group that’s been working for years on the front line. They know what needs to be done. Your job is to unblock and boost their efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your first task should be to find that group and start to build trust with them. Building trust is important and necessary, particularly now when the most visible technologists are the ones doing the most damage. The most important thing you do is listen and learn. Understanding what your partner organization is doing and why is vital for knowing how to best help them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-three-do-the-work&quot;&gt;Step Three: Do the work&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early civic tech, and maybe even today’s civic tech, has a hero problem. There was this idea that we could drop teams of talented technologists into a city hall or government agency and solve all the problems! We had all the good ideas!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not that scenario. It didn’t really work back then and it’s not going to work now. Leave the heroics at the door, you’re a tech grunt now and you’re going to be doing a lot of grunt work. Necessary. Vital. Grunt work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s teaching cybersecurity basics. That’s putting up a website. That’s helping with social media. That’s doing excel magic. That’s right, a lot of organizations are run by spreadsheets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There may be times when they will need an app, but a lot of the work may end up being basic block and tackle technology work. It’s still important. Remember, civic tech is an enabling function and we’re enabling the organizations that are reducing harm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-four-share-wins-and-lessons&quot;&gt;Step Four: Share wins and lessons&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the times ahead we’ll have both challenges and wins. As we do, it’s important to share those stories with other groups doing this work so they can learn from your mistakes and victories. Blogging and telling those stories is work, but if another group faces the same challenges you did they’re now at an advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can help share those stories through ACT newsletter or your own blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;we-will-get-there&quot;&gt;We will get there&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next few years will be difficult, but the key thing for us to remember is that our jobs will be to reduce harm wherever we can. If food prices go up, helping a food pantry get food on the table is a win. If the administration targets our cities for mass deportation campaigns, every door that doesn’t open without a warrant is a win. Every activist that doesn’t get hacked because they were coached on cybersecurity is a win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll get there, and we’ll be there with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;⠀
This list represents not only a milestone in our journey, but also a celebration of the incredible diversity and expertise that our members bring to the table. From data scientists and software developers to policy advocates and community organizers, ACT members are united by a shared passion for tech-driven civic engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;thanks-chi-hack-night--open-austin&quot;&gt;Thanks Chi Hack Night &amp;amp; Open Austin&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We would like to extend a heartfelt thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://chihacknight.org/&quot;&gt;Chi Hack Night&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.open-austin.org/&quot;&gt;Open Austin&lt;/a&gt; for their incredible support. As pillars of their respective civic tech communities, they have been a constant source of inspiration and collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chi Hack Night graciously hosted our Executive Director, Christopher Whitaker, for a &lt;a href=&quot;https://chihacknight.org/events/2024/10/29/act&quot;&gt;special event&lt;/a&gt;, back in October 2024, where he shared the launch of ACT. More recently, they also penned a thoughtful &lt;a href=&quot;https://chihacknight.org/blog/2024/12/16/2024-joining-act&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; about ACT, detailing its origins, mission, and their decision to join our growing network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Open Austin partnered with us on a successful social media campaign to promote their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/posts/open-austin_during-welcome-2025-public-interest-tech-activity-7288227344815661056-8MYB/&quot;&gt;Welcome 2025 ATX Public Interest Tech Mixer&lt;/a&gt;, which resulted in the event selling out. The mixer brought together 37 attendees, including resident activists, community and nonprofit leaders, and local government staff—40% of whom were people of color, and 31% were women and non-binary folks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is exactly the kind of collaboration we aim to amplify within the network—strengthening local civic tech communities and fostering an inclusive, engaged network of individuals and organizations across the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A huge thank you to Chi Hack Night and Open Austin for their continued support and commitment to advancing the civic tech movement!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;goal-setting&quot;&gt;Goal Setting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ACT’s members have been renewing their focus on setting impactful goals. From advancing civic tech projects to fostering stronger community connections, our members are defining their objectives for the year ahead. For example &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civictechatlanta.org/&quot;&gt;Civic Tech Atlanta&lt;/a&gt; has shared this simplified list:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Structure a formal project lifecycle pipeline.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Keep a pulse on volunteer relations.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Build up their network with local and public organizations.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mature our administrative operations for sustainability.
⠀
We invite you to check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civictechatlanta.org/&quot;&gt;Civic Tech Atlanta’s website&lt;/a&gt;, along with those of our other members, to see how each of them is strategically setting the course to make a meaningful impact in the civic tech space!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;delegates-meeting&quot;&gt;Delegates Meeting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ACT will be holding its next Delegates Meeting on Thursday, February 20, 2025, at 6:00 PM PT / 9:00 PM ET, with a Zoom link provided to each member’s delegates directly. During this meeting, there will be discussion and vote on a resolution and action plan, as outlined in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civictechnologists.org/2025/01/committment-to-supporting-our-communities&quot;&gt;joint statement with the Technologists for the Public Good&lt;/a&gt;. This is an important opportunity for all members to engage in shaping the future direction of ACT and its collaborative initiatives. Be sure to join us and have your voice heard!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Commitment to Supporting Our Communities</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/media/2025/act-logo.png&quot; alt=&quot;Logo of the Alliance of Civic Technologists&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/media/2025/tpg-logo.png&quot; alt=&quot;Logo of Technologists for Public Good&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light of the current administration’s executive orders adversely impacting Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans, and Queer/Questioning (LGBTQ+) rights; Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEIA) programs; immigrant communities; and the Federal workforce, the Alliance of Civic Technologists and Technologists for Public Good are issuing a joint statement &lt;strong&gt;reaffirming our commitment to support all individuals working to improve civic society and public government.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This includes technologists who are trans, queer, immigrants, disabled, remote workers, and technologists across disciplines and issue areas. Our communities welcome all individuals without regard to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual identity or orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, age, race, color, culture, language, nationality, citizenship, country of origin, profession, religion, political beliefs, veteran status, genetic features, genetic information, or any other any other identity or characteristic. Our support extends to their rights regarding access to healthcare and benefits, dignity, freedom of movement, and protection from harassment and discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our organizations believe that programs supporting diversity, inclusion, equity, and accessibility improve our government workforce and aid in making government more innovative and responsive to the needs of everyone in our communities. Our organizations believe that better solutions come from embracing diversity, not excluding it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While our organizations primarily support technologists, we’re lucky enough to partner with dedicated folks in public service and across multiple sectors and organizations and work together to provide needed solutions to the American people. Our jobs simply aren’t possible without all of the people it takes to deliver effective public services; we value all of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This joint statement is a first step. We will continue to support and highlight efforts in our communities to advance this commitment. Technologists for Public Good has been and will continue to proactively provide &lt;a href=&quot;https://community.publicgood.tech/c/resources/quick-resources-if-you-re-expecting-to-unexpectedly-leave-federal-service&quot;&gt;resources&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://community.publicgood.tech/c/events/resume-review-1-29-25&quot;&gt;programs&lt;/a&gt; for people to reference and take action as well as are building out advocacy priorities with members over the coming months. The Alliance of Civic Technologists will work with Technologists for Public Good to promote these resources and the Board of the Alliance of Civic Technologists will submit a resolution and action plan for a vote by the full membership at our next delegate meeting in late February.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The success of our communities and the positive impact their work has had on improving the lives of Americans is made possible because of the contributions of our LGBTQ+, immigrant, disabled, remote, and other diverse peers. The Alliance of Civic Technologists and Technologists for the Public Good stand in solidarity with our friends, neighbors, and colleagues in these communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alliance of Civic Technologists&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;first-town-hall&quot;&gt;First Town Hall&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will be holding our first Town Hall, to provide anyone and everyone in our network a chance to have a voice and brainstorm with us on how to make our community even better than it already is.

&lt;p&gt;The announcement of our First Town Hall marks the beginning of a quarterly cycle of monthly meetings, scheduled for every third Thursday of the month. Our goal is to establish a sustainable approach to consistent communication and engagement with both our members and the broader community, while actively implementing and responding to valuable feedback. Each quarter will feature a series of three meetings, beginning with the Town Hall to foster brainstorming and ideation. This will be followed by a Delegate’s Meeting to further promote collaboration and partnerships, and will conclude with a Mixer to celebrate our successes and achievements.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>ACT December News Letter: Meet our first members!</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;act-welcomes-first-new-members&quot;&gt;ACT Welcomes First New Members&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Alliance of Civic Technologists welcomed its first batch of eight members into the network this month. Our inaugural members include &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civictechatlanta.org/&quot;&gt;Civic Tech Atlanta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://codefordayton.org/&quot;&gt;Code for Dayton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sfcivictech.org/&quot;&gt;SF Civic Tech&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://codeforphilly.org/&quot;&gt;Code for Philly&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://beta.nyc/&quot;&gt;BetaNYC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://chihacknight.org/&quot;&gt;Chi Hack Night,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.codeforboston.org/&quot;&gt;Code for Boston&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://codeforbtv.github.io/&quot;&gt;Code for BTV.&lt;/a&gt; We plan to onboard more members soon and are still accepting applications for new members. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civictechnologists.org/&quot;&gt;Interested groups can apply on our homepage&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;come-hang-out-with-us&quot;&gt;Come hang out with us&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On December 19th at 9:00 PM EST / 6:00 PM PST, ACT will host a virtual Civic Technology Holiday Mixer. It’s been too long since we’ve gotten together, and we wanted a chance to celebrate the launch of our new network. All are welcome! &lt;a href=&quot;https://us06web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZYtf-Ghpj0qHNzOamBiD0U0lx9GIvbEYnJa&quot;&gt;Register for the event here&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;civic-tech-atlanta-helps-feed-the-people&quot;&gt;Civic Tech Atlanta Helps Feed The People&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.civictechatlanta.org/&quot;&gt;Civic Tech Atlanta&lt;/a&gt; partnered with &lt;a href=&quot;https://solidaritysandysprings.org/&quot;&gt;Solidarity Food Pantry&lt;/a&gt; to help clean up their data and create user friendly improvements to their reporting system. The pantry, started in March 2020 to help food-insecure families during the COVID shutdowns. That grew into a community movement to help overlooked families. Civic Tech Atlanta was honored to help those families feel uplifted, supported and food secure. Solidarity Pantry has helped serve over 100,000 people since its opening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While taking the opportunity to make some internal changes during moving physical locations, Solidarity realized they had a need to improve their current data quality and data intake system. Partially for the sake of organization and reporting, but primarily to prepare for a future data migration, Solidarity needed to review their historical data and reporting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Civic Tech Atlanta worked with Solidarity to review historical data and identify data validation issues (potential duplicates, invalid addresses, entry errors, etc.), propose simple improvements to the current ad-hoc reporting system and understand the data and assist in preparing a data structure for a future migration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;network-roundup&quot;&gt;Network Roundup&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some quick notes about what’s been happening in the network!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://floridainnovation.org/&quot;&gt;Florida Community Innovation&lt;/a&gt; recently launched its digital humanities project, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gobituary.app/&quot;&gt;www.gobituary.app&lt;/a&gt;.

        <title>ACT October &apos;24 Newsletter: Membership Applications Open October 29th During Virtual Session of Chi Hack Night</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;membership-applications-open-october-29th-during-virtual-session-of-chi-hack-night&quot;&gt;Membership Applications Open October 29th During Virtual Session of Chi Hack Night&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On October 29th, our Executive Director Christopher Whitaker will be speaking at Chi Hack Night to announce the launch of the Alliance of Civic Technologists inaugural membership drive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll  be talking a bit about the history of local volunteer civic tech organizations, the advantages of being part of a network, and how ACT can support the future growth of the civic tech movement by working to convene, enable, celebrate and advocate for civic volunteers across the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The event will be virtual and will start at 7:00 PM CST. &lt;a href=&quot;https://chihacknight.org/events/2024/10/29/act&quot;&gt;You can join the zoom call here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope you’ll join us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;christopher-whitaker-named-executive-director&quot;&gt;Christopher Whitaker named Executive Director&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past year, the Board and our counsel have been working to secure our non-profit status and build the ACT organization. We’re now at the point where ACT is stable and ready to grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to accelerate this and set ACT up to be the organization we all want it to be, the Board has asked Christopher Whitaker to be the Executive Director of ACT, and charged him with the development of the organization, its strategic direction, and bylaws. Noel Hidalgo, Jill Bjers, and Harlan Weber will continue to act in our roles on the Board of Directors through at least the process of establishing the organization, supported by Matt Zagaja as Treasurer, Brianda Hernandez as Secretary, Jill Bjers as auditor, and Jake Durrell as Counsel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Christopher has been a long time organizer in the civic technology space as one of Code for America’s first volunteer captains in 2013 as well as being a long time member of Chi Hack Night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Christopher has a hybrid background in public administration and product management having served in both delivery and operations roles at the Defense Digital Service, United States Digital Service, and Code for America. Christopher was recently hired by Skylight to support the US Air Force BESPIN software factory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;preview-of-our-bylaws-and-mou&quot;&gt;Preview of our Bylaws and MOU&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we approach launch day, we wanted to share a preview of the ACT’s draft  &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gDhnQqsY3El2BfJuL7J_RHkY3eqJonRm4hZAY0PjBqY/edit&quot;&gt;bylaws&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TBfWrQPz4FwIKeJmsOSek9GSfBfQMFnXMAUbJgRs1fY/edit#heading=h.h2i5p3uasqof&quot;&gt;MOU’s&lt;/a&gt; that we’ll ask member organizations to sign when they join the network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Alliance of Civic Technologists will be a decentralized network &lt;em&gt;run by the membership.&lt;/em&gt;  The member organizations will each be represented by two delegates and an alternate who will have the ability to vote in board elections, our budget, as well as propose resolutions to state ACT’s stance on important issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ACT intends to conduct business in an open and transparent manner. As a good first step, we want to offer a preview into our bylaws and our memorandum of understanding. We’ll open these documents up for feedback until the 29th before formally adopting them. During our first ACT Congress in Summer 2025, we’ll also have the chance to amend our bylaws as needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;join-our-discord&quot;&gt;Join our Discord&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ACT maintains a Discord server where we facilitate conversations between volunteer civic technology leaders across the country. &lt;a href=&quot;https://discord.gg/EM6ywtMhkP&quot;&gt;Join us today!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>July ACT Newsletter: Writing our values, Code for Boston&apos;s MAPLE Launch and the Florida Resource Map</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;figure&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/2023-07-20-project-maple.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Code for Boston meeting around a conference table.&quot; class=&quot;figure-img&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the ACT July Newsletter! We’re hoping that everyone is staying safe and cool during the extreme weather we’re having.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;writing-out-our-values&quot;&gt;Writing out our values&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a few weeks of reviewing what volunteer groups put together in 2017, we now have an initial draft of our mission, values, and operating principles. Thank you to everyone who contributed their feedback!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next step will be to share the draft document with our delegates for feedback. We’ll meet at a delegate-only meeting on July 27th to review the proposal and possibly vote for its approval. In the meantime, you can read and &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DMUMw9Vm0b8rQ7_EnKwGouUXJrIIykIFxTcDxWjZcms/edit&quot;&gt;comment on the proposed document here&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;code-for-bostons-maple-testimony-goes-live-in-massachusetts&quot;&gt;Code for Boston’s MAPLE Testimony goes live in Massachusetts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bostonglobe.com/2023/04/13/opinion/civic-tech-maple-massachusetts/&quot;&gt;Boston Globe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://commonwealthmagazine.org/politics/a-digital-push-for-more-legislative-participation/&quot;&gt;Commonwealth Magazine&lt;/a&gt;, Code for Boston’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mapletestimony.org/&quot;&gt;MAPLE app&lt;/a&gt; - the Massachusetts Platform for Legislative Engagement - aims to make it easy for MA residents to submit testimony to the state Legislature on the bills that determine the future of the Commonwealth. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eventbrite.com/e/the-massachusetts-platform-for-legislative-engagement-launch-event-tickets-657791430877&quot;&gt;MAPLE will launch their v1 app on Thursday, July 20&lt;/a&gt; after a year of amazing work by a dedicated team of Code for Boston volunteers, led by Matt Victor, in partnership with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nulawlab.org/&quot;&gt;NULawLab&lt;/a&gt; at Northeastern. Learn more about the project (and check out the code!) on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/codeforboston/maple&quot;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;florida-resource-map&quot;&gt;Florida Resource Map&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent months, student interns and the developer team at &lt;a href=&quot;https://floridainnovation.org/&quot;&gt;Florida Community Innovation&lt;/a&gt; (FCI) have been creating version three of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.floridaresourcemap.org/&quot;&gt;Florida Resource Map&lt;/a&gt;. The Map is a tool for Floridians to find social services (food banks, job resources, healthcare, etc.) near them on a unified digital platform. Our tool is also designed so social workers can customize suggestions of resources for their clients. The Map will compile a database of resources gathered from our nonprofit partners across Florida.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;act-reaches-twenty-members&quot;&gt;ACT reaches twenty members&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ACT continues to grow, with three more members signing on and bringing our total number of members to twenty. We were recently joined by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.codeforatlanta.org/&quot;&gt;Code for Atlanta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.meetup.com/code-for-hawaii/&quot;&gt;Code for Hawaii&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://openstl.org/&quot;&gt;OpenSTL&lt;/a&gt; (St Louis). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Does your local civic tech organization have a story to tell? Want to be featured in our next newsletter? Reach out to us at hello@civictechnologists.org&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;thanks-for-all-you-do&quot;&gt;Thanks for all you do!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks again for all of your support and everything you do.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>ACT June Social Hour</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Happy Friday!  The Alliance of Civic Technologists would like to invite you to a virtual social hour on June 29th at 8:30 PM EST / 5:30 PM to celebrate our filing as a 501c3!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is our first step in becoming a fully-fledged non-profit. We’ll be filing in Illinois on Thursday and we’ll work with delegates from member organizations across the county to write our bylaws and continue the work supporting the civic technology volunteer network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://us06web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZUoduutrj0pHNGBZ3zoYJwGE21n8AvtlRoo&quot;&gt;You can register for the social hour here!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks so much for all you do,&lt;br /&gt;
Christopher, Jill, and Harlan&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>ACT June Newsletter</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello! Welcome to our first newsletter! It’s been a month since we first launched the Alliance of Civic Technologists and we wanted to give an update on our progress and what’s next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But first we wanted to give a big thank you to our initial volunteers and donors. Our launch would not have been possible without people raising their hands to help us stand up the network! Thank you! 🎉&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our First ACT Meeting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re giving former members of Code for America Brigades and interested local civic tech organizations until Friday, June 16th to sign their letters of intent and name their delegates. On Monday, June 19th we’ll send out a pool asking delegates to indicate their availability for our first meeting. If you are a local leader and haven’t received your letter of intent, please email &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:hello@civictechnologists.org&quot;&gt;hello@civictechnologists.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Logo!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve visited our website, &lt;a href=&quot;https://civictechnologists.org&quot;&gt;civictechnologists.org&lt;/a&gt;, in the last week, you may have noticed that we have a new logo! The connected star logo was inspired by Code for Australia’s original ‘network’ design with ACT taking a page out of Canada’s book and using the flag star to represent the US. Our colors are Old Glory Red and Democracy Blue. We wanted to give a big shout out to Molly McLeod (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mollymcleod.com/&quot;&gt;https://www.mollymcleod.com/&lt;/a&gt;) for the design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Call for Feedback on our Vision, Mission and Values&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2017, the civic technology organizations came together at Code for America’s Brigade Congress and drafted a Mission/Vision/Operating Principles document that reflected the values of the Brigade network. Since that time, Code for America has taken the finalized document off their website. However, this document was preserved in Github and ACT has forked it as it’s a useful starting point for setting our own vision, mission, and values. You can comment and suggest changes &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h-cNQtJrMZi3yaohQIJPMbxh4lnKzUQtI_Vm0ptBExA/edit&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. We’ll keep the comment section open until we formally adopt our governance structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay in touch via Discord&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re interested in chatting with the community in real time, we have an open discord server at &lt;a href=&quot;https://discord.gg/EM6ywtMhkP&quot;&gt;https://discord.gg/EM6ywtMhkP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks so much,&lt;br /&gt;
The ACT Comms Team&lt;br /&gt;
(Christopher, Brianda, Ben and Jill)&lt;/p&gt;
