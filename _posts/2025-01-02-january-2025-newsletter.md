### First Town Hall

We will be holding our first Town Hall, to provide anyone and everyone in our network a chance to have a voice and brainstorm with us on how to make our community even better than it already is. The meeting will be hosted using Zoom on the third Thursday of January, (01/16/2025) at 6:00 PM PT/9:00 PM ET. Please use the [Zoom registration link](https://us06web.zoom.us/meeting/register/2HOhy2i_SzeacXMSAkuLig) to sign up.

### Meeting Cadence

The announcement of our First Town Hall marks the beginning of a quarterly cycle of monthly meetings, scheduled for every third Thursday of the month. Our goal is to establish a sustainable approach to consistent communication and engagement with both our members and the broader community, while actively implementing and responding to valuable feedback. Each quarter will feature a series of three meetings, beginning with the Town Hall to foster brainstorming and ideation. This will be followed by a Delegate’s Meeting to further promote collaboration and partnerships, and will conclude with a Mixer to celebrate our successes and achievements.

### Help Wanted: Join an ACT Committee!

The Alliance of Civic Technologists is looking for volunteers to help staff our working committees. These committees will help us manage the day to day operations of our network including helping craft our website, recruiting new members into the network, and hosting our first ACT Congress. Volunteers to work on committees must come from member organizations, but they do not have to be the delegate. We’re specifically recruiting for the Communications, Membership, and Events Committees. If you are interested, please email [hello@civictechnologists.org](mailto:hello@civictechnologists.org)
