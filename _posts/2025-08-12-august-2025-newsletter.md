### Director’s Update

With the passage of the One Big Bill, the social safety net in our communities are facing dramatic cuts as the effects of the bill become law.  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that nearly 16 million people will lose access to Medicaid. The Urban Institute estimates that 22.3 million families would lose some of all of their food assistance. In addition, the Executive Order signed in late July is set to undermine state and local efforts to address homelessness.  
  
These developments are alarming and should be viewed as a call to action. Member organizations across the country were already at work to try to mitigate harm and boost community non-profits that have been in the trenches working on these difficult issues. 

Open Source San Jose is currently actively working on Tally Up - a small web based application for tallying the meals handed out to children in need in partnership with the California Department of Education. Civic Tech Atlanta provided data support services to Sanctuary Food Pantry. Code for Philly is working on Phlask, a map of food, water, bathrooms, and foraging. 

And the CityCamp events this fall will provide additional opportunities for us as civic technologists to find ways we can pitch in to help. CityCamps are unconference events that will bring together city officials, technologists, and community non-profit leaders to ideate on ways we can work together to reduce harm in our communities. ACT is an organizing partner for CityCamp and if you’re interested in holding one in your city please reach out! 

### Open Source San José

We’re excited to welcome [Open Source San José (OSSJ)](https://opensourcesanjose.org/) as the newest member of the Alliance of Civic Technologists! This collective is uniting volunteer coders, designers, researchers, community members & more in solving local issues for the San José area of California. Their work in harnessing open source tools and community-driven innovation to make local government more transparent, inclusive, and responsive aligns seamlessly with ACT’s mission to support local organizations building better public services through tech and design. We’re thrilled to officially be their partner and included on their journey to creating more equitable civic solutions for San José. 

### Civic Spark

Part conference, part unconference, [Civic Spark](https://civic-spark.com/), happening in-person from August 16-17, brings together civic technologists, organizers, and community builders from all across North America to share what’s working, name what’s not, and ignite action for a more equitable public future. [Join them](https://lu.ma/civic-spark) for two days of connection, collaboration, and candid conversations to build what’s next, together! Learn more & register at: [civic-spark.com](https://civic-spark.com/)

While at Civic Spark make sure to stop by and say hi to our member [Code for Boston](https://www.codeforboston.org/), they will be presenting at the conference. You can also check out their work ahead of time at [codeforboston.org/projects](http://codeforboston.org/projects). Our Executive Director Christopher Whitaker will also be there as part of a panel discussion on regional cooperation in civic tech. 

### Network Roundup

Here are some quick notes, about what’s been happening in the network!

#### MAPLE

[Code for Boston](https://www.codeforboston.org/) is reimaging civic participation with MAPLE, the [Massachusetts Platform for Legislative Engagement](https://www.codeforboston.org/projects/#:~:text=Massachusetts%20Platform%20for%20Legislative%20Engagement). A new digital tool making it easier than ever for residents to submit testimony to the Massachusetts legislature and read what others are saying. By creating a public archive of testimony, simplifying the submission process, and fostering ongoing dialogue between constituents and lawmakers, [MAPLE](https://www.mapletestimony.org/) opens the doors of the statehouse to more voices. A bold step toward a more transparent, accessible, and responsive legislative process.

#### Civic Tech Stories & Tools

Real change starts with real stories. [Code for Dayton](https://www.codefordayton.org/)’s [Civic Tech Stories & Tools](https://www.codefordayton.org/toolbox/) project brings problem-solving to life, showcasing how everyday tools, human-centered thinking, and a little creativity can tackle big community challenges. From the first spark of an idea to the measurable impact, each story reveals the full journey and tech that made it possible. Whether you’re new to civic tech or seeking proven approaches, these stories offer inspiration and practical insight. Dive in and discover how accessible tools are powering change across the [ACT Network](https://www.civictechnologists.org/about#:~:text=Member%20Organizations).

#### Benefit Decision Toolkit

What if benefit experts could build their own tools, without needing a team of developers? [Code for Philly](https://codeforphilly.org/)’s [Benefit Decision Toolkit](https://codeforphilly.org/projects/dmn_benefit_toolbox-including_the_philly_property_tax_relief_screener) makes that possible. Designed to streamline the creation of eligibility screeners, this toolkit empowers subject matter experts to translate their knowledge into digital services quickly and accurately. No need to start from scratch or reinvent the wheel. [The toolkit](https://phillypropertytaxrelief.org/) simplifies complex rules management so communities can launch helpful, human-centered tools faster. It’s a smarter way to build and a great example of civic tech in action.

### Upcoming Events
#### 8/17 - Summer Delegates Meeting

ACT's Summer Delegates Meeting, [happening August 21st 2025](https://us06web.zoom.us/meeting/register/uJiMnOV-THiu_Xenq4XmuA), is your space to connect with fellow civic tech leaders across the United States, get feedback on what you're working on, and ask for support where you need it most. Whether you're refining a project, launching a new idea, or just want to listen and learn, this is a collaborative space for open conversation and real-time connection. Bring your questions, your wins, and you're work-in-progress. Let's make this summer count. See you there!

Everyone interested in civic tech is welcome. Delegates are encouraged to attend. [All required to RSVP](https://us06web.zoom.us/meeting/register/uJiMnOV-THiu_Xenq4XmuA).
