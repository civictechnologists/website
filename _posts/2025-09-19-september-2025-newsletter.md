### Director’s Update

It’s finally here! We wanted to shoot a quick note before the weekend to talk about [CityCamp](https://citycamp.com/). We’re proud to partner with CityCamp to organize nine different CityCamp events across the country to bring together technologists, community leaders, and city stakeholders to foster civic collaboration and innovation.  This is a great opportunity to find ways we can help reduce harm in our communities - particularly in light of the One Big Bill.

[BetaNYC](https://www.beta.nyc/) held their CityCamp on September 6th with over 200 people in attendance. During their morning class, they launched an updated Introduction to Open Data class that includes City and State open data platforms, as well as several open data tools we use. [This whole video is presented in American Sign Language \(ASL\) with spoken audio and text subtitles.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFz8iJ5-jd8)

We’ll be following along on all the CityCamp events on social media using the hashtag `#citycamp`. You can check out all the events at the CityCamp website at [citycamp.com](http://citycamp.com/).

We’d like to extend a huge thank you to all our organizers for making this happen including our events committee chair Nicole Dan from [Florida Innovation Council](https://floridainnovation.org/) for spearheading this effort.

We’ll be reaching out to all of our organizers after CityCamp to help tell their stories, so be on the lookout for news coming out of CityCamp in our October newsletter.
