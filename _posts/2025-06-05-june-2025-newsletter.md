### Director‚Äôs Update

The Alliance of Civic Technologists is running full steam ahead as we enter summer. We‚Äôre excited to announce three major milestones as we continue to grow and support the network of civic tech volunteer organizations: ACT Congress, Board Elections and City Camp!¬†

While I‚Äôm excited to see this progress, I want to state emphatically that none of this would be possible without the support of our volunteers. Our secretary, Brianda Hernandez, has been making sure this newsletter goes out every month and has done a great job making sure all your stories get told to the wider network. Behind the scenes, Ben Sheldon has been updating our website and Jake Durell has been working to ensure our 501c3 status. Our involvement in bringing back City Camp, an unconference event that brings together technologists and civic leaders, would simply not be possible without the leadership of Nicole Dan and Nikhil Sangamkar.¬†

And of course, we‚Äôre grateful for the work that civic technologists across the country are putting into their communities. From helping to [prepare for disasters](https://www.volunteermatch.org/search/opp3952332.jsp) in San Francisco, to gathering over [600 people in New York](https://www.beta.nyc/2025/05/06/nyc-open-data-week-2025-in-review/) to learn and innovate, to helping [reduce gun violence in Philadelphia](https://cleanandgreenphilly.org/) by cleaning and greening vacant properties, your work during these difficult times is impressive and important.  
  
So thank you, for all that you do.¬†

### First ACT Congress

We‚Äôre excited to invite you to the first-ever ACT Congress, hosted by the Alliance of Civic Technologists, happening virtually on **Saturday, June 28, 2025**! This groundbreaking, half-day [unconference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference) is open to everyone and will feature engaging, participant-led sessions focused on shaping the future of our community, our mission, and civic technology as a whole.¬†

The day will begin with an exclusive **delegates-only breakfast session**, where we‚Äôll make key decisions about the organization‚Äôs future, including a member vote of the **2025-2026 budget** and holding our **inaugural board election**, a major milestone. For those not attending the delegate breakfast, we‚Äôll be hosting a meet and greet session in parallel.¬†

Following breakfast, virtual doors will open to the broader public for a dynamic and interactive lineup of sessions driven by YOU, the attendees. Whether you‚Äôre a civic technologist, nonprofit leader, public servant, or simply curious about the future of digital civic engagement, ACT Congress will be a space to connect, contribute, and co-create.¬†

For more details and registration please visit [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/alliance-of-civic-technologists-congress-tickets-1367857601909). Then, don‚Äôt forget to mark your calendar and stay tuned, because you won‚Äôt want to miss this!¬†

### First Board Election¬†

ACT is holding our first board elections during the first session of ACT Congress! Our bylaws, passed earlier this year, calls for a board of seven each serving three year terms that are staggered. Currently, the board is at three members and this election will bring the number of board members to five. Our board is selected by the delegates of each member organization who join prior to June 28th.¬†

We encourage anyone who is interested in helping guide ACT‚Äôs future to consider a run. We estimate a time commitment of three to five hours a month. Board members are expected to attend our monthly meetings and help steer one of our working committees.  
  
For this election, we‚Äôll be voting on four seats. Three of these will be for three year terms and one for a two year term. Anyone from our member organizations can run for a board seat by [filling out this short form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScR019CmVVFjFg7OIRWZ_r2vsyZrcCxIoZ0d2QC_j6Q6nNaXA/viewform?usp=dialog).
