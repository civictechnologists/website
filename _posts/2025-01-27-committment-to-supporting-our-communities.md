In light of the current administration’s executive orders adversely impacting Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans, and Queer/Questioning (LGBTQ+) rights; Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEIA) programs; immigrant communities; and the Federal workforce, the Alliance of Civic Technologists and Technologists for Public Good are issuing a joint statement **reaffirming our commitment to support all individuals working to improve civic society and public government.**

This includes technologists who are trans, queer, immigrants, disabled, remote workers, and technologists across disciplines and issue areas. Our communities welcome all individuals without regard to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual identity or orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, age, race, color, culture, language, nationality, citizenship, country of origin, profession, religion, political beliefs, veteran status, genetic features, genetic information, or any other any other identity or characteristic. Our support extends to their rights regarding access to healthcare and benefits, dignity, freedom of movement, and protection from harassment and discrimination.

**Our organizations believe that programs supporting diversity, inclusion, equity, and accessibility improve our government workforce and aid in making government more innovative and responsive to the needs of everyone in our communities. Our organizations believe that better solutions come from embracing diversity, not excluding it.**

While our organizations primarily support technologists, we’re lucky enough to partner with dedicated folks in public service and across multiple sectors and organizations and work together to provide needed solutions to the American people. Our jobs simply aren't possible without all of the people it takes to deliver effective public services; we value all of them.

This joint statement is a first step. We will continue to support and highlight efforts in our communities to advance this commitment. Technologists for Public Good has been and will continue to proactively provide [resources](https://community.publicgood.tech/c/resources/quick-resources-if-you-re-expecting-to-unexpectedly-leave-federal-service) and [programs](https://community.publicgood.tech/c/events/resume-review-1-29-25) for people to reference and take action as well as are building out advocacy priorities with members over the coming months. The Alliance of Civic Technologists will work with Technologists for Public Good to promote these resources and the Board of the Alliance of Civic Technologists will submit a resolution and action plan for a vote by the full membership at our next delegate meeting in late February.

The success of our communities and the positive impact their work has had on improving the lives of Americans is made possible because of the contributions of our LGBTQ+, immigrant, disabled, remote, and other diverse peers. The Alliance of Civic Technologists and Technologists for the Public Good stand in solidarity with our friends, neighbors, and colleagues in these communities.
