### Giving Thanks to the Helpers

This year has been challenging to so many of us and our communities that I wanted to take a moment to thank everyone for the work you all are doing and supporting both inside and outside of our own groups. 2025 was a year marked with the decimation of many premier organizations in our field including the United States Digital Service, 18F, as well as countless civil servants within federal agencies being forced from public service. The cuts to SNAP benefits, even before the shutdown threatened to cut them off completely, are greatly concerning to those who want everyone in our communities to have access to healthy food. For cities like mine with large immigrant populations, the actions of federal immigration agents kidnapping our neighbors and deploying tear gas on the streets in which we live has been the stuff of nightmares.  It’s times like these that I’m particularly thankful for the helpers and those bringing people together to find solutions to problems in our neighborhoods. Florida Community Innovation recently launched a [resource map to help people find](https://civictechnologists.us21.list-manage.com/track/click?u=260d034255cbcfd0e6ff509f7&id=77060a1dec&e=3cb2aae057) food, aid, and shelter. The efforts from [Civic Tech Atlanta](https://civictechnologists.us21.list-manage.com/track/click?u=260d034255cbcfd0e6ff509f7&id=c16a393a25&e=3cb2aae057)  to support Solidarity Food Pantry are paying further dividends as the need for food aid increases.  It’s also been a year of bringing people together. [BetaNYC](https://civictechnologists.us21.list-manage.com/track/click?u=260d034255cbcfd0e6ff509f7&id=818b4badc9&e=3cb2aae057) had over 600 registrations for their NYC School of Data event! Their annual gathering brings together civic technologists, data enthusiasts, and community leaders to learn, collaborate, and drive innovation. ACT members also hosted nine different [CityCamps](https://civictechnologists.us21.list-manage.com/track/click?u=260d034255cbcfd0e6ff509f7&id=49cf9218eb&e=3cb2aae057)  throughout the country helping bring together technologists, public servants and community leaders to find ways that technology can enable good work in our neighborhoods. OpenAustin held a [twelve week fellowship](https://civictechnologists.us21.list-manage.com/track/click?u=260d034255cbcfd0e6ff509f7&id=a222f47abb&e=3cb2aae057) to develop aspiring technologists’ confidence, technical competence, and collaboration through experiential learning and mentorship.  

While these examples have mostly been civic tech focused, we’d be remiss if we didn’t acknowledge the community organizing and activism that occurs outside those spaces. The challenge of the times will take work from all of us in many different ways - and I’m thankful for them all.
