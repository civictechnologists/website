### Civic Tech Atlanta Helps Feed The People

 [Civic Tech Atlanta](https://www.civictechatlanta.org/) partnered with [Solidarity Food Pantry](https://solidaritysandysprings.org/) to help clean up their data and create user friendly improvements to their reporting system. The pantry, started in March 2020 to help food-insecure families during the COVID shutdowns. That grew into a community movement to help overlooked families. Civic Tech Atlanta was honored to help those families feel uplifted, supported and food secure. Solidarity Pantry has helped serve over 100,000 people since its opening.

While taking the opportunity to make some internal changes during moving physical locations, Solidarity realized they had a need to improve their current data quality and data intake system. Partially for the sake of organization and reporting, but primarily to prepare for a future data migration, Solidarity needed to review their historical data and reporting.

Civic Tech Atlanta worked with Solidarity to review historical data and identify data validation issues (potential duplicates, invalid addresses, entry errors, etc.), propose simple improvements to the current ad-hoc reporting system and understand the data and assist in preparing a data structure for a future migration.
