### BetaNYC Hits 600+ for NYC School of Data!

We’re excited to announce that [BetaNYC](https://beta.nyc/) has reached an incredible milestone—600+ registrations for their [NYC School of Data](https://schoolofdata.nyc/) event! This annual gathering brings together civic technologists, data enthusiasts, and community leaders to learn, collaborate, and drive innovation. With such an overwhelming response, this year’s event promises to be an incredible opportunity for networking, skill-building, and exchanging ideas that will shape the future of data in New York City. We’re proud of BetaNYC for the hard work and dedication they’ve put into organizing this amazing civic tech event, and we’re equally grateful to everyone who registered and supported it. Here’s to continuing the momentum and creating lasting impact!
