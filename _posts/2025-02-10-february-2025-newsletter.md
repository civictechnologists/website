### Thanks Chi Hack Night & Open Austin

We would like to extend a heartfelt thanks to [Chi Hack Night](https://chihacknight.org/) and [Open Austin](https://www.open-austin.org/) for their incredible support. As pillars of their respective civic tech communities, they have been a constant source of inspiration and collaboration.

Chi Hack Night graciously hosted our Executive Director, Christopher Whitaker, for a [special event](https://chihacknight.org/events/2024/10/29/act), back in October 2024, where he shared the launch of ACT. More recently, they also penned a thoughtful [blog post](https://chihacknight.org/blog/2024/12/16/2024-joining-act) about ACT, detailing its origins, mission, and their decision to join our growing network.

Meanwhile, Open Austin partnered with us on a successful social media campaign to promote their [Welcome 2025 ATX Public Interest Tech Mixer](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/open-austin_during-welcome-2025-public-interest-tech-activity-7288227344815661056-8MYB/), which resulted in the event selling out. The mixer brought together 37 attendees, including resident activists, community and nonprofit leaders, and local government staff—40% of whom were people of color, and 31% were women and non-binary folks.

This is exactly the kind of collaboration we aim to amplify within the network—strengthening local civic tech communities and fostering an inclusive, engaged network of individuals and organizations across the country.

A huge thank you to Chi Hack Night and Open Austin for their continued support and commitment to advancing the civic tech movement!

### Goal Setting
ACT’s members have been renewing their focus on setting impactful goals. From advancing civic tech projects to fostering stronger community connections, our members are defining their objectives for the year ahead. For example [Civic Tech Atlanta](https://www.civictechatlanta.org/) has shared this simplified list:

1. Structure a formal project lifecycle pipeline.
2. Keep a pulse on volunteer relations.
3. Build up their network with local and public organizations.
4. Mature our administrative operations for sustainability.
   ⠀
   We invite you to check out [Civic Tech Atlanta’s website](https://www.civictechatlanta.org/), along with those of our other members, to see how each of them is strategically setting the course to make a meaningful impact in the civic tech space!

### Delegates Meeting
ACT will be holding its next Delegates Meeting on Thursday, February 20, 2025, at 6:00 PM PT / 9:00 PM ET, with a Zoom link provided to each member’s delegates directly. During this meeting, there will be discussion and vote on a resolution and action plan, as outlined in our [joint statement with the Technologists for the Public Good](https://www.civictechnologists.org/2025/01/committment-to-supporting-our-communities). This is an important opportunity for all members to engage in shaping the future direction of ACT and its collaborative initiatives. Be sure to join us and have your voice heard!
