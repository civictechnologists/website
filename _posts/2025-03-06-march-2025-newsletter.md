### First Resolution 

During the most recent delegates meeting, the first resolution for the Alliance of Civic Technologists (ACT) was unanimously passed. [RESOLUTION ONE - TWENTY-TWENTY-FIVE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WVGqfxORJQqpzm-RiM8wf1PgiR2JTzekW-vMnxX-srk/edit?usp=sharing) is a direct response from ACT and its members to the current administration’s executive orders and actions that are adversely impacting the rights of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans, and Queer/Questioning (LGBTQ+) individuals, Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEIA) initiatives, immigrant communities, and the federal workforce. This resolution also serves as a strong statement of support for these communities and programs by ACT’s members. 

> "In short, our communities welcome all - but compassionately reject harmful actions."

### Join Our Network: Organizers Needed 

The Alliance of Civic Technologists is actively recruiting organizers to support member organizations in Tulsa, Baltimore, Dallas, and Nebraska. If you’re passionate about making an impact, we’d love to hear from you! Reach out to [hello@civictechnologists.org](mailto:hello@civictechnologists.org) to get involved. 

### We Support 18F

As of March 1, 2025, 18F, a program within the [General Services Administration (GSA)](https://www.gsa.gov/), has officially been [shut down](https://fedscoop.com/gsa-shutters-18f-possibly-leaving-agencies-in-the-lurch/). However, the talented team of tech consultants and engineers, who built open-source tools to improve digital services across the federal government has [come together](https://bsky.app/profile/alt18f.bsky.social). Their dedication to helping, “[the government to fix things](https://18f.org/#:~:text=the%20government%20to%20fix%20things),” is absolutely inspirational, and we’re excited to witness their work as they continue their mission, driving a positive change in the civic tech community.
