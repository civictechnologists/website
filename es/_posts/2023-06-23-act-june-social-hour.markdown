Happy Friday!  The Alliance of Civic Technologists would like to invite you to a virtual social hour on June 29th at 8:30 PM EST / 5:30 PM to celebrate our filing as a 501c3! 

This is our first step in becoming a fully-fledged non-profit. We’ll be filing in Illinois on Thursday and we’ll work with delegates from member organizations across the county to write our bylaws and continue the work supporting the civic technology volunteer network. 

[You can register for the social hour here!](https://us06web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZUoduutrj0pHNGBZ3zoYJwGE21n8AvtlRoo)

Thanks so much for all you do,<br>
Christopher, Jill, and Harlan
