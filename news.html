Each quarter will feature a series of three meetings, beginning with the Town Hall to foster brainstorming and ideation. This will be followed by a Delegate’s Meeting to further promote collaboration and partnerships, and will conclude with a Mixer to celebrate our successes and achievements.</p>

<p>On December 19th at 9:00 PM EST / 6:00 PM PST, ACT will host a virtual Civic Technology Holiday Mixer. It’s been too long since we’ve gotten together, and we wanted a chance to celebrate the launch of our new network.

<h3 id="civic-tech-atlanta-helps-feed-the-people">Civic Tech Atlanta Helps Feed The People</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.civictechatlanta.org/">Civic Tech Atlanta</a> partnered with <a href="https://solidaritysandysprings.org/">Solidarity Food Pantry</a> to help clean up their data and create user friendly improvements to their reporting system. The pantry, started in March 2020 to help food-insecure families during the COVID shutdowns. That grew into a community movement to help overlooked families. Civic Tech Atlanta was honored to help those families feel uplifted, supported and food secure. Solidarity Pantry has helped serve over 100,000 people since its opening.</p>

<p>While taking the opportunity to make some internal changes during moving physical locations, Solidarity realized they had a need to improve their current data quality and data intake system. Partially for the sake of organization and reporting, but primarily to prepare for a future data migration, Solidarity needed to review their historical data and reporting.</p>

<p>Civic Tech Atlanta worked with Solidarity to review historical data and identify data validation issues (potential duplicates, invalid addresses, entry errors, etc.), propose simple improvements to the current ad-hoc reporting system and understand the data and assist in preparing a data structure for a future migration.</p>

<p>On October 29th, our Executive Director Christopher Whitaker will be speaking at Chi Hack Night to announce the launch of the Alliance of Civic Technologists inaugural membership drive.</p>

<p>We’ll  be talking a bit about the history of local volunteer civic tech organizations, the advantages of being part of a network, and how ACT can support the future growth of the civic tech movement by working to convene, enable, celebrate and advocate for civic volunteers across the country.</p>

<p>The event will be virtual and will start at 7:00 PM CST. <a href="https://chihacknight.org/events/2024/10/29/act">You can join the zoom call here</a>.</p>

<p>We hope you’ll join us.</p>

<h3 id="christopher-whitaker-named-executive-director">Christopher Whitaker named Executive Director</h3>

<p>Over the past year, the Board and our counsel have been working to secure our non-profit status and build the ACT organization. We’re now at the point where ACT is stable and ready to grow.</p>

<p>In order to accelerate this and set ACT up to be the organization we all want it to be, the Board has asked Christopher Whitaker to be the Executive Director of ACT, and charged him with the development of the organization, its strategic direction, and bylaws. Noel Hidalgo, Jill Bjers, and Harlan Weber will continue to act in our roles on the Board of Directors through at least the process of establishing the organization, supported by Matt Zagaja as Treasurer, Brianda Hernandez as Secretary, Jill Bjers as auditor, and Jake Durrell as Counsel.</p>

<p>Christopher has been a long time organizer in the civic technology space as one of Code for America’s first volunteer captains in 2013 as well as being a long time member of Chi Hack Night.</p>

<p>Christopher has a hybrid background in public administration and product management having served in both delivery and operations roles at the Defense Digital Service, United States Digital Service, and Code for America. Christopher was recently hired by Skylight to support the US Air Force BESPIN software factory.</p>

<h3 id="preview-of-our-bylaws-and-mou">Preview of our Bylaws and MOU</h3>

<p>As we approach launch day, we wanted to share a preview of the ACT’s draft  <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gDhnQqsY3El2BfJuL7J_RHkY3eqJonRm4hZAY0PjBqY/edit">bylaws</a> and the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TBfWrQPz4FwIKeJmsOSek9GSfBfQMFnXMAUbJgRs1fY/edit#heading=h.h2i5p3uasqof">MOU’s</a> that we’ll ask member organizations to sign when they join the network.</p>

<p>The Alliance of Civic Technologists will be a decentralized network <em>run by the membership.</em>  The member organizations will each be represented by two delegates and an alternate who will have the ability to vote in board elections, our budget, as well as propose resolutions to state ACT’s stance on important issues.</p>

<p>ACT intends to conduct business in an open and transparent manner. As a good first step, we want to offer a preview into our bylaws and our memorandum of understanding. We’ll open these documents up for feedback until the 29th before formally adopting them. During our first ACT Congress in Summer 2025, we’ll also have the chance to amend our bylaws as needed.</p>

<h3 id="join-our-discord">Join our Discord</h3>

<p>ACT maintains a Discord server where we facilitate conversations between volunteer civic technology leaders across the country. <a href="https://discord.gg/EM6ywtMhkP">Join us today!</a></p>

<p>Welcome to the ACT July Newsletter! We’re hoping that everyone is staying safe and cool during the extreme weather we’re having.</p>

<h3 id="writing-out-our-values">Writing out our values</h3>

<p>After a few weeks of reviewing what volunteer groups put together in 2017, we now have an initial draft of our mission, values, and operating principles. Thank you to everyone who contributed their feedback!</p>

<p>The next step will be to share the draft document with our delegates for feedback. We’ll meet at a delegate-only meeting on July 27th to review the proposal and possibly vote for its approval. In the meantime, you can read and <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DMUMw9Vm0b8rQ7_EnKwGouUXJrIIykIFxTcDxWjZcms/edit">comment on the proposed document here</a>!</p>

<p>In recent months, student interns and the developer team at <a href="https://floridainnovation.org/">Florida Community Innovation</a> (FCI) have been creating version three of the <a href="https://www.floridaresourcemap.org/">Florida Resource Map</a>. The Map is a tool for Floridians to find social services (food banks, job resources, healthcare, etc.) near them on a unified digital platform. Our tool is also designed so social workers can customize suggestions of resources for their clients. The Map will compile a database of resources gathered from our nonprofit partners across Florida.</p>

    <p>Hello! Welcome to our first newsletter! It’s been a month since we first launched the Alliance of Civic Technologists and we wanted to give an update on our progress and what’s next.</p>

<p>But first we wanted to give a big thank you to our initial volunteers and donors. Our launch would not have been possible without people raising their hands to help us stand up the network! Thank you! 🎉</p>

<p><strong>Our First ACT Meeting</strong></p>

<p>We’re giving former members of Code for America Brigades and interested local civic tech organizations until Friday, June 16th to sign their letters of intent and name their delegates. On Monday, June 19th we’ll send out a pool asking delegates to indicate their availability for our first meeting. If you are a local leader and haven’t received your letter of intent, please email <a href="mailto:hello@civictechnologists.org">hello@civictechnologists.org</a>.</p>

<p><strong>New Logo!</strong></p>

<p>If you’ve visited our website, <a href="https://civictechnologists.org">civictechnologists.org</a>, in the last week, you may have noticed that we have a new logo! The connected star logo was inspired by Code for Australia’s original ‘network’ design with ACT taking a page out of Canada’s book and using the flag star to represent the US. Our colors are Old Glory Red and Democracy Blue. We wanted to give a big shout out to Molly McLeod (<a href="https://www.mollymcleod.com/">https://www.mollymcleod.com/</a>) for the design.</p>

<p><strong>Call for Feedback on our Vision, Mission and Values</strong></p>

<p>In 2017, the civic technology organizations came together at Code for America’s Brigade Congress and drafted a Mission/Vision/Operating Principles document that reflected the values of the Brigade network. Since that time, Code for America has taken the finalized document off their website. However, this document was preserved in Github and ACT has forked it as it’s a useful starting point for setting our own vision, mission, and values. You can comment and suggest changes <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h-cNQtJrMZi3yaohQIJPMbxh4lnKzUQtI_Vm0ptBExA/edit">here</a>. We’ll keep the comment section open until we formally adopt our governance structure.</p>

<p><strong>Stay in touch via Discord</strong></p>

<p>If you’re interested in chatting with the community in real time, we have an open discord server at <a href="https://discord.gg/EM6ywtMhkP">https://discord.gg/EM6ywtMhkP</a></p>

<p>Thanks so much,<br />
The ACT Comms Team<br />
