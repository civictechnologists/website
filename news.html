    <h3 id="directors-update">Director’s Update</h3>

<p>With the passage of the One Big Bill, the social safety net in our communities are facing dramatic cuts as the effects of the bill become law.  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that nearly 16 million people will lose access to Medicaid. The Urban Institute estimates that 22.3 million families would lose some of all of their food assistance. In addition, the Executive Order signed in late July is set to undermine state and local efforts to address homelessness.</p>

<p>These developments are alarming and should be viewed as a call to action. Member organizations across the country were already at work to try to mitigate harm and boost community non-profits that have been in the trenches working on these difficult issues. </p>

<p>Open Source San Jose is currently actively working on Tally Up - a small web based application for tallying the meals handed out to children in need in partnership with the California Department of Education. Civic Tech Atlanta provided data support services to Sanctuary Food Pantry. Code for Philly is working on Phlask, a map of food, water, bathrooms, and foraging. </p>

<p>And the CityCamp events this fall will provide additional opportunities for us as civic technologists to find ways we can pitch in to help. CityCamps are unconference events that will bring together city officials, technologists, and community non-profit leaders to ideate on ways we can work together to reduce harm in our communities. ACT is an organizing partner for CityCamp and if you’re interested in holding one in your city please reach out! </p>

<p>I want to give a big thank you to everyone who participated in our first ACT Congress. The joy of these unconference events is that you never quite know where the conversations are going to go. I appreciate people’s willingness to take on hard topics and ideate on how we can make this community and our country better.</p>

<p>The next big event on our calendar will be CityCamp starting in the fall and culminating in World CityCamp Day on September 20th.  CityCamp is a global movement of community-focused events that foster civic collaboration and innovation. These events bring people together to improve their communities. ACT is an organizing partner with CityCamp with Nicole Dan from Florida Community Innovation leading efforts on our side.</p>

<p>With the passage of the One Big Bill, we’re looking at drastic cuts to the social safety net including food assistance, Medicaid, and healthcare. Community organizations and local governments will be on the front lines working to stem the damage. They’ll need support.</p>

<p>CityCamp will provide us an opportunity to bring local government officials, technologists, and community organizations together to find ways to enable the work of taking care of each other.</p>

<h3 id="new-board">New Board</h3>

    <h3 id="directors-update">Director’s Update</h3>

<p>The Alliance of Civic Technologists is running full steam ahead as we enter summer. We’re excited to announce three major milestones as we continue to grow and support the network of civic tech volunteer organizations: ACT Congress, Board Elections and City Camp! </p>

<p>While I’m excited to see this progress, I want to state emphatically that none of this would be possible without the support of our volunteers. Our secretary, Brianda Hernandez, has been making sure this newsletter goes out every month and has done a great job making sure all your stories get told to the wider network. Behind the scenes, Ben Sheldon has been updating our website and Jake Durell has been working to ensure our 501c3 status. Our involvement in bringing back City Camp, an unconference event that brings together technologists and civic leaders, would simply not be possible without the leadership of Nicole Dan and Nikhil Sangamkar. </p>

<p>And of course, we’re grateful for the work that civic technologists across the country are putting into their communities. From helping to <a href="https://www.volunteermatch.org/search/opp3952332.jsp">prepare for disasters</a> in San Francisco, to gathering over <a href="https://www.beta.nyc/2025/05/06/nyc-open-data-week-2025-in-review/">600 people in New York</a> to learn and innovate, to helping <a href="https://cleanandgreenphilly.org/">reduce gun violence in Philadelphia</a> by cleaning and greening vacant properties, your work during these difficult times is impressive and important.</p>

<p>So thank you, for all that you do. </p>

<h3 id="first-act-congress">First ACT Congress</h3>

<p>We’re excited to invite you to the first-ever ACT Congress, hosted by the Alliance of Civic Technologists, happening virtually on <strong>Saturday, June 28, 2025</strong>! This groundbreaking, half-day <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference">unconference</a> is open to everyone and will feature engaging, participant-led sessions focused on shaping the future of our community, our mission, and civic technology as a whole. </p>

<p>The day will begin with an exclusive <strong>delegates-only breakfast session</strong>, where we’ll make key decisions about the organization’s future, including a member vote of the <strong>2025-2026 budget</strong> and holding our <strong>inaugural board election</strong>, a major milestone. For those not attending the delegate breakfast, we’ll be hosting a meet and greet session in parallel. </p>

<p>Following breakfast, virtual doors will open to the broader public for a dynamic and interactive lineup of sessions driven by YOU, the attendees. Whether you’re a civic technologist, nonprofit leader, public servant, or simply curious about the future of digital civic engagement, ACT Congress will be a space to connect, contribute, and co-create. </p>

<p>For more details and registration please visit <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/alliance-of-civic-technologists-congress-tickets-1367857601909">Eventbrite</a>. Then, don’t forget to mark your calendar and stay tuned, because you won’t want to miss this! </p>

<h3 id="first-board-election">First Board Election </h3>

<p>ACT is holding our first board elections during the first session of ACT Congress! Our bylaws, passed earlier this year, calls for a board of seven each serving three year terms that are staggered. Currently, the board is at three members and this election will bring the number of board members to five. Our board is selected by the delegates of each member organization who join prior to June 28th. </p>

<p>We encourage anyone who is interested in helping guide ACT’s future to consider a run. We estimate a time commitment of three to five hours a month. Board members are expected to attend our monthly meetings and help steer one of our working committees.</p>

<p>For this election, we’ll be voting on four seats. Three of these will be for three year terms and one for a two year term. Anyone from our member organizations can run for a board seat by <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScR019CmVVFjFg7OIRWZ_r2vsyZrcCxIoZ0d2QC_j6Q6nNaXA/viewform?usp=dialog">filling out this short form</a>.

<p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/civicwhitaker.com/post/3lnnuzmpoq22o">Our union-made two inch hex stickers</a> are finally here! Over the next week, member organizations that submitted designs, should expect to hear from us and will have their stickers shipped to them.</p>

<p>Those not a part of the Alliance of Civic Technologists or its member organizations, but still want a sticker, will have a chance, by as Open Austin says “keeping the lights on” and <a href="https://hcb.hackclub.com/donations/start/alliance-of-civic-technologists">donating</a> between now and May 15th, (with your email included.) All profits from this donation drive will be used to help support our CityCamp initiative in the fall.</p>

<h3 id="citycamp-comeback">CityCamp Comeback</h3>

<p>For those that don’t remember or know, <a href="https://citycamp.com/">CityCamp</a> is a global movement of community-focused events that foster civic collaboration and innovation. The <a href="http://barcamp.org/w/page/25504543/CityCamp-Original">first CityCamp</a> was held January 2010, in Chicago, Illinois. It was then established as an <a href="https://citycamp.com/news/how-citycamp-became-an-open-source-brand">open source brand</a> so that anyone could host events anywhere.</p>

<p>This year, the Alliance of Civic Technologists, with our member organizations, has been partnering with CityCamp, as an Organizing Partner, to host events across the country! Our series of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference">unconferences</a> will follow the same blueprint as previously held CityCamps, casual community-focused events designed to foster participant-led civic sessions with local residents, elected officials, government staff, civic leaders, entrepreneurs, designers, developers, and journalists thoughtfully discussing or engaging in activities surrounding the themes of arts, civic engagement, civic technology, economics, education, environment, housing, human services, open government, safety, emergency management, health and transportation. Ending with World CityCamp Day 2025 on September 20th, 2025. To register for your city’s CityCamp, visit <a href="http://citycamp.com">citycamp.com</a>.</p>

    <h3 id="first-resolution">First Resolution</h3>

<p>During the most recent delegates meeting, the first resolution for the Alliance of Civic Technologists (ACT) was unanimously passed. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WVGqfxORJQqpzm-RiM8wf1PgiR2JTzekW-vMnxX-srk/edit?usp=sharing">RESOLUTION ONE - TWENTY-TWENTY-FIVE</a> is a direct response from ACT and its members to the current administration’s executive orders and actions that are adversely impacting the rights of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans, and Queer/Questioning (LGBTQ+) individuals, Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEIA) initiatives, immigrant communities, and the federal workforce. This resolution also serves as a strong statement of support for these communities and programs by ACT’s members.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“In short, our communities welcome all - but compassionately reject harmful actions.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="join-our-network-organizers-needed">Join Our Network: Organizers Needed</h3>

<p>The Alliance of Civic Technologists is actively recruiting organizers to support member organizations in Tulsa, Baltimore, Dallas, and Nebraska. If you’re passionate about making an impact, we’d love to hear from you! Reach out to <a href="mailto:hello@civictechnologists.org">hello@civictechnologists.org</a> to get involved.</p>

<h3 id="we-support-18f">We Support 18F</h3>

<p>As of March 1, 2025, 18F, a program within the <a href="https://www.gsa.gov/">General Services Administration (GSA)</a>, has officially been <a href="https://fedscoop.com/gsa-shutters-18f-possibly-leaving-agencies-in-the-lurch/">shut down</a>. However, the talented team of tech consultants and engineers, who built open-source tools to improve digital services across the federal government has <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/alt18f.bsky.social">come together</a>. Their dedication to helping, “<a href="https://18f.org/#:~:text=the%20government%20to%20fix%20things">the government to fix things</a>,” is absolutely inspirational, and we’re excited to witness their work as they continue their mission, driving a positive change in the civic tech community.</p>

          <img src="/media/2025/cancer_or_dinosaurs.jpg" alt="A spiderman comic: I don't want to cure cancer, I want to turn people into dinosaurs!" style="max-width: 300px" />
    </a>
</p>

<p>The past few weeks have featured an unprecedented assault on the United States Constitution, civil rights, and America’s public servants.</p>

<p>And contrary to some media narratives, there’s fierce opposition to everything that’s happening. That opposition will play out in the courts. It will play out in the streets and it will eventually play out at the ballot box.</p>

<p>These efforts will take time.  As most of us are non-partisan, non-profits, these efforts take place outside our lanes. This does not negate those efforts, this post is mostly aimed at what civic tech volunteer groups can do.</p>

<p>Authoritarian regimes want to crush the opposition. Part of this means ensuring that if you’re not compliant, things will be unbearable and unsustainable.</p>

<p>With this in mind, one of the best uses of our time and effort is in <em>harm reduction.</em> Reducing the harm brought on by the new administration will buy time and space for vulnerable communities.</p>

<p>Reducing harm will mean empowering and enabling community organisations that are on the front lines supporting vulnerable communities helping to solve their problems and enhance their capabilities.</p>

<p>One of the biggest wins that civic tech likes to brag about is Clear My Record — a product that helps to expunge weed convictions from criminal records. For one thing, this only works in states  that allow for that. And how did we states that allowed for that? Years and years of grassroots activists doing the work of community organizing and advocating for change. The biggest piece and the hardest part had nothing to do with tech. You had to literally change laws.</p>

<p>The activists and their advocates in the legislature were the ones driving the effort. Civic technologists came in during the implementation phase and helped to enable it.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.civictechatlanta.org/">Civic Tech Atlanta</a> partnered with Solidarity Food Pantry to help clean up their data and create user friendly improvements to their reporting system. The pantry, started in March 2020 to help food-insecure families during the COVID shutdowns. That grew into a community movement to help overlooked families. Civic Tech Atlanta was honored to help those families feel uplifted, supported and food secure. Solidarity Pantry has helped serve over 100,000 people since its opening.</p>

<p>While taking the opportunity to make some internal changes during moving physical locations, Solidarity realized they had a need to improve their current data quality and data intake system. Partially for the sake of organization and reporting, but primarily to prepare for a future data migration, Solidarity needed to review their historical data and reporting.</p>

<p>Civic Tech Atlanta worked with Solidarity to review historical data and identify data validation issues (potential duplicates, invalid addresses, entry errors, etc.), propose simple improvements to the current ad-hoc reporting system and understand the data and assist in preparing a data structure for a future migration.</p>

<p>It’s important to keep the concept of <em>enablement</em> in mind - because what we enable is important. <a href="https://www.eatingpolicy.com/p/bringing-elon-to-a-knife-fight">Government efficiency, in it of itself, is not harm reduction.</a></p>

<p>There’s a lot of work to be done to push back against the oligarchy. Some of this work will be political, some of this work will be in the courts, and some of it will be on the streets.</p>

<p>With that in mind, here are some steps you can take to support your communities.</p>

<h3 id="step-one-find-your-team">Step One: Find your team</h3>

<p>Developing technology is a team sport, and even more so in the field of civic technology. There’s very little you can achieve solo. So, the first step is to find a team. If you’re in Chicago, your starting point will be Chi Hack Night at one of our weekly hack nights. For those outside of Chicago, the Alliance of Civic Technologists is a network of local organizations with member organizations in 13 cities and recruiting brand new volunteer civic tech volunteer groups. (<a href="https://www.civictechnologists.org/about">You can find a list of our current members on our website</a>!)</p>

<p>Ideally, you want to have enough skillsets on your team to be able to take on a variety of challenges.</p>

<h3 id="step-two-find-your-allies-and-understand-their-needs">Step Two: Find your allies and understand their needs</h3>

<p>You probably have a particular set of skills and experiences that make you great at creating code, or designing great user experiences, or understanding how to use and manipulate data. These are usual skills, but you likely lack domain knowledge and expertise for problem sets like immigrant rights, investigating corruption, health care, and criminal justice reform.</p>

<p>For every major problem we’re facing, there’s likely a group that’s been working for years on the front line. They know what needs to be done. Your job is to unblock and boost their efforts.</p>

<p>Your first task should be to find that group and start to build trust with them. Building trust is important and necessary, particularly now when the most visible technologists are the ones doing the most damage. The most important thing you do is listen and learn. Understanding what your partner organization is doing and why is vital for knowing how to best help them.</p>

<h3 id="step-three-do-the-work">Step Three: Do the work</h3>

<p>Early civic tech, and maybe even today’s civic tech, has a hero problem. There was this idea that we could drop teams of talented technologists into a city hall or government agency and solve all the problems! We had all the good ideas!</p>

<p>This is not that scenario. It didn’t really work back then and it’s not going to work now. Leave the heroics at the door, you’re a tech grunt now and you’re going to be doing a lot of grunt work. Necessary. Vital. Grunt work.</p>

<p>That’s teaching cybersecurity basics. That’s putting up a website. That’s helping with social media. That’s doing excel magic. That’s right, a lot of organizations are run by spreadsheets.</p>

<p>There may be times when they will need an app, but a lot of the work may end up being basic block and tackle technology work. It’s still important. Remember, civic tech is an enabling function and we’re enabling the organizations that are reducing harm.</p>

<h3 id="step-four-share-wins-and-lessons">Step Four: Share wins and lessons</h3>

<p>In the times ahead we’ll have both challenges and wins. As we do, it’s important to share those stories with other groups doing this work so they can learn from your mistakes and victories. Blogging and telling those stories is work, but if another group faces the same challenges you did they’re now at an advantage.</p>

<p>You can help share those stories through ACT newsletter or your own blog.</p>

<h3 id="we-will-get-there">We will get there</h3>

<p>The next few years will be difficult, but the key thing for us to remember is that our jobs will be to reduce harm wherever we can. If food prices go up, helping a food pantry get food on the table is a win. If the administration targets our cities for mass deportation campaigns, every door that doesn’t open without a warrant is a win. Every activist that doesn’t get hacked because they were coached on cybersecurity is a win.</p>

<p>We’ll get there, and we’ll be there with you.</p>

<h3 id="thanks-chi-hack-night--open-austin">Thanks Chi Hack Night &amp; Open Austin</h3>

<p>We would like to extend a heartfelt thanks to <a href="https://chihacknight.org/">Chi Hack Night</a> and <a href="https://www.open-austin.org/">Open Austin</a> for their incredible support. As pillars of their respective civic tech communities, they have been a constant source of inspiration and collaboration.</p>

<p>Chi Hack Night graciously hosted our Executive Director, Christopher Whitaker, for a <a href="https://chihacknight.org/events/2024/10/29/act">special event</a>, back in October 2024, where he shared the launch of ACT. More recently, they also penned a thoughtful <a href="https://chihacknight.org/blog/2024/12/16/2024-joining-act">blog post</a> about ACT, detailing its origins, mission, and their decision to join our growing network.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Open Austin partnered with us on a successful social media campaign to promote their <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/open-austin_during-welcome-2025-public-interest-tech-activity-7288227344815661056-8MYB/">Welcome 2025 ATX Public Interest Tech Mixer</a>, which resulted in the event selling out. The mixer brought together 37 attendees, including resident activists, community and nonprofit leaders, and local government staff—40% of whom were people of color, and 31% were women and non-binary folks.</p>

<p>This is exactly the kind of collaboration we aim to amplify within the network—strengthening local civic tech communities and fostering an inclusive, engaged network of individuals and organizations across the country.</p>

<p>A huge thank you to Chi Hack Night and Open Austin for their continued support and commitment to advancing the civic tech movement!</p>

<h3 id="goal-setting">Goal Setting</h3>

<p>In light of the current administration’s executive orders adversely impacting Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans, and Queer/Questioning (LGBTQ+) rights; Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEIA) programs; immigrant communities; and the Federal workforce, the Alliance of Civic Technologists and Technologists for Public Good are issuing a joint statement <strong>reaffirming our commitment to support all individuals working to improve civic society and public government.</strong></p>

<p>This includes technologists who are trans, queer, immigrants, disabled, remote workers, and technologists across disciplines and issue areas. Our communities welcome all individuals without regard to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual identity or orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, age, race, color, culture, language, nationality, citizenship, country of origin, profession, religion, political beliefs, veteran status, genetic features, genetic information, or any other any other identity or characteristic. Our support extends to their rights regarding access to healthcare and benefits, dignity, freedom of movement, and protection from harassment and discrimination.</p>

<p><strong>Our organizations believe that programs supporting diversity, inclusion, equity, and accessibility improve our government workforce and aid in making government more innovative and responsive to the needs of everyone in our communities. Our organizations believe that better solutions come from embracing diversity, not excluding it.</strong></p>

<p>While our organizations primarily support technologists, we’re lucky enough to partner with dedicated folks in public service and across multiple sectors and organizations and work together to provide needed solutions to the American people. Our jobs simply aren’t possible without all of the people it takes to deliver effective public services; we value all of them.</p>

<p>This joint statement is a first step. We will continue to support and highlight efforts in our communities to advance this commitment. Technologists for Public Good has been and will continue to proactively provide <a href="https://community.publicgood.tech/c/resources/quick-resources-if-you-re-expecting-to-unexpectedly-leave-federal-service">resources</a> and <a href="https://community.publicgood.tech/c/events/resume-review-1-29-25">programs</a> for people to reference and take action as well as are building out advocacy priorities with members over the coming months. The Alliance of Civic Technologists will work with Technologists for Public Good to promote these resources and the Board of the Alliance of Civic Technologists will submit a resolution and action plan for a vote by the full membership at our next delegate meeting in late February.</p>

<p>The success of our communities and the positive impact their work has had on improving the lives of Americans is made possible because of the contributions of our LGBTQ+, immigrant, disabled, remote, and other diverse peers. The Alliance of Civic Technologists and Technologists for the Public Good stand in solidarity with our friends, neighbors, and colleagues in these communities.</p>

<p>On December 19th at 9:00 PM EST / 6:00 PM PST, ACT will host a virtual Civic Technology Holiday Mixer. It’s been too long since we’ve gotten together, and we wanted a chance to celebrate the launch of our new network.

<h3 id="civic-tech-atlanta-helps-feed-the-people">Civic Tech Atlanta Helps Feed The People</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.civictechatlanta.org/">Civic Tech Atlanta</a> partnered with <a href="https://solidaritysandysprings.org/">Solidarity Food Pantry</a> to help clean up their data and create user friendly improvements to their reporting system. The pantry, started in March 2020 to help food-insecure families during the COVID shutdowns. That grew into a community movement to help overlooked families. Civic Tech Atlanta was honored to help those families feel uplifted, supported and food secure. Solidarity Pantry has helped serve over 100,000 people since its opening.</p>

<p>While taking the opportunity to make some internal changes during moving physical locations, Solidarity realized they had a need to improve their current data quality and data intake system. Partially for the sake of organization and reporting, but primarily to prepare for a future data migration, Solidarity needed to review their historical data and reporting.</p>

<p>Civic Tech Atlanta worked with Solidarity to review historical data and identify data validation issues (potential duplicates, invalid addresses, entry errors, etc.), propose simple improvements to the current ad-hoc reporting system and understand the data and assist in preparing a data structure for a future migration.</p>

<p>On October 29th, our Executive Director Christopher Whitaker will be speaking at Chi Hack Night to announce the launch of the Alliance of Civic Technologists inaugural membership drive.</p>

<p>We’ll  be talking a bit about the history of local volunteer civic tech organizations, the advantages of being part of a network, and how ACT can support the future growth of the civic tech movement by working to convene, enable, celebrate and advocate for civic volunteers across the country.</p>

<p>The event will be virtual and will start at 7:00 PM CST. <a href="https://chihacknight.org/events/2024/10/29/act">You can join the zoom call here</a>.</p>

<p>We hope you’ll join us.</p>

<h3 id="christopher-whitaker-named-executive-director">Christopher Whitaker named Executive Director</h3>

<p>Over the past year, the Board and our counsel have been working to secure our non-profit status and build the ACT organization. We’re now at the point where ACT is stable and ready to grow.</p>

<p>In order to accelerate this and set ACT up to be the organization we all want it to be, the Board has asked Christopher Whitaker to be the Executive Director of ACT, and charged him with the development of the organization, its strategic direction, and bylaws. Noel Hidalgo, Jill Bjers, and Harlan Weber will continue to act in our roles on the Board of Directors through at least the process of establishing the organization, supported by Matt Zagaja as Treasurer, Brianda Hernandez as Secretary, Jill Bjers as auditor, and Jake Durrell as Counsel.</p>

<p>Christopher has been a long time organizer in the civic technology space as one of Code for America’s first volunteer captains in 2013 as well as being a long time member of Chi Hack Night.</p>

<p>Christopher has a hybrid background in public administration and product management having served in both delivery and operations roles at the Defense Digital Service, United States Digital Service, and Code for America. Christopher was recently hired by Skylight to support the US Air Force BESPIN software factory.</p>

<h3 id="preview-of-our-bylaws-and-mou">Preview of our Bylaws and MOU</h3>

<p>As we approach launch day, we wanted to share a preview of the ACT’s draft  <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gDhnQqsY3El2BfJuL7J_RHkY3eqJonRm4hZAY0PjBqY/edit">bylaws</a> and the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TBfWrQPz4FwIKeJmsOSek9GSfBfQMFnXMAUbJgRs1fY/edit#heading=h.h2i5p3uasqof">MOU’s</a> that we’ll ask member organizations to sign when they join the network.</p>

<p>The Alliance of Civic Technologists will be a decentralized network <em>run by the membership.</em>  The member organizations will each be represented by two delegates and an alternate who will have the ability to vote in board elections, our budget, as well as propose resolutions to state ACT’s stance on important issues.</p>

<p>ACT intends to conduct business in an open and transparent manner. As a good first step, we want to offer a preview into our bylaws and our memorandum of understanding. We’ll open these documents up for feedback until the 29th before formally adopting them. During our first ACT Congress in Summer 2025, we’ll also have the chance to amend our bylaws as needed.</p>

<h3 id="join-our-discord">Join our Discord</h3>

<p>ACT maintains a Discord server where we facilitate conversations between volunteer civic technology leaders across the country. <a href="https://discord.gg/EM6ywtMhkP">Join us today!</a></p>

<p>After a few weeks of reviewing what volunteer groups put together in 2017, we now have an initial draft of our mission, values, and operating principles. Thank you to everyone who contributed their feedback!</p>

<p>The next step will be to share the draft document with our delegates for feedback. We’ll meet at a delegate-only meeting on July 27th to review the proposal and possibly vote for its approval. In the meantime, you can read and <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DMUMw9Vm0b8rQ7_EnKwGouUXJrIIykIFxTcDxWjZcms/edit">comment on the proposed document here</a>!</p>

The Map is a tool for Floridians to find social services (food banks, job resources, healthcare, etc.) near them on a unified digital platform. Our tool is also designed so social workers can customize suggestions of resources for their clients.

    <p>Hello! Welcome to our first newsletter! It’s been a month since we first launched the Alliance of Civic Technologists and we wanted to give an update on our progress and what’s next.</p>

<p>But first we wanted to give a big thank you to our initial volunteers and donors. Our launch would not have been possible without people raising their hands to help us stand up the network! Thank you! 🎉</p>

<p><strong>Our First ACT Meeting</strong></p>

<p>We’re giving former members of Code for America Brigades and interested local civic tech organizations until Friday, June 16th to sign their letters of intent and name their delegates. On Monday, June 19th we’ll send out a pool asking delegates to indicate their availability for our first meeting.

<p>If you’ve visited our website, <a href="https://civictechnologists.org">civictechnologists.org</a>, in the last week, you may have noticed that we have a new logo! The connected star logo was inspired by Code for Australia’s original ‘network’ design with ACT taking a page out of Canada’s book and using the flag star to represent the US. Our colors are Old Glory Red and Democracy Blue. We wanted to give a big shout out to Molly McLeod (<a href="https://www.mollymcleod.com/">https://www.mollymcleod.com/</a>) for the design.</p>

<p><strong>Call for Feedback on our Vision, Mission and Values</strong></p>

<p>In 2017, the civic technology organizations came together at Code for America’s Brigade Congress and drafted a Mission/Vision/Operating Principles document that reflected the values of the Brigade network. Since that time, Code for America has taken the finalized document off their website. However, this document was preserved in Github and ACT has forked it as it’s a useful starting point for setting our own vision, mission, and values. You can comment and suggest changes <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h-cNQtJrMZi3yaohQIJPMbxh4lnKzUQtI_Vm0ptBExA/edit">here</a>. We’ll keep the comment section open until we formally adopt our governance structure.</p>

<p><strong>Stay in touch via Discord</strong></p>

<p>If you’re interested in chatting with the community in real time, we have an open discord server at <a href="https://discord.gg/EM6ywtMhkP">https://discord.gg/EM6ywtMhkP</a></p>

<p>Thanks so much,<br />
The ACT Comms Team<br />
